JSON Path
=========

Find the path of a key / value in a JSON hierarchy *easily*.

Rationale
---------

When working with big and nested JSON files, sometimes
it's very difficult to figure out the path of a key. You
open the JSON file in a text editor, find the key / value
pair you need, but then it can be a pain to get the full path of the key.

Example
-------

Consider the following JSON file:

```json
{
    "a": 1,
    "b": {
        "c": 2,
        "friends": [
            {
                "best": "Alice"
            },
            {
                "second": "Bob"
            },
            [5, 6, 7],
            [
                {"one": 1},
                {"two": 2}
            ]
        ]
    }
}
```

JSON Path will traverse it recursively and print every
path / value pair:

```bash
$ ./json_path.py sample.json
root.a => 1
root.b.c => 2
root.b.friends[0].best => Alice
root.b.friends[1].second => Bob
root.b.friends[2][0] => 5
root.b.friends[2][1] => 6
root.b.friends[2][2] => 7
root.b.friends[3][0].one => 1
root.b.friends[3][1].two => 2
```

The idea is to combine its usage with the Unix command
`grep`. For instance, what's the path of the key that
leads to Bob?

```bash
$ ./json_path.py sample.json | grep Bob
root.b.friends[1].second => Bob
```

Then simply paste it in your application:

```python
>>> d
{'a': 1, 'b': {'c': 2, 'friends': [{'best': 'Alice'}, {'second': 'Bob'}, [5, 6, 7], [{'one': 1}, {'two': 2}]]}}
>>> d['b']['friends'][1]['second']
'Bob'
>>>
```

See Chris Nielsen's excellent [JSON Visualization](http://chris.photobooks.com/json/default.htm)
webapp. Somewhat hidden feature, but if you click on an item in the table,
you'll get its path on the left side. I wanted something similar in the command line. Once I
was working with sensitive data, and I didn't want to paste them in a third-party webapp.
